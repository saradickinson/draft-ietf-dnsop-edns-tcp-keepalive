    <abstract>
      <t>DNS messages between clients and servers may be received
	over either UDP or TCP. UDP transport involves keeping less
	state on a busy server, but can cause truncation and retries
	over TCP. Additionally, UDP can be exploited for reflection
	attacks. Using TCP would reduce retransmits and amplification.
	However, both clients and servers are currently limited in their use of the
	TCP transport as RFC 5966 suggests that "that the default 
	application-level idle period should be of the order of seconds".</t>

      <t>This document defines an EDNS0 option ("edns-tcp-keepalive")
	that allows DNS servers to signal a variable idle timeout.
	This signalling facilitates a better balance of
	UDP and TCP transport between individual clients and servers,
	reducing the impact of problems associated with UDP transport and
	allowing the state associated with TCP transport to be managed
	effectively with minimal impact on the DNS transaction time.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>DNS messages between clients and servers may be received
        over either UDP or TCP <xref target="RFC1035"/>. Historically,
        DNS clients used API's that only facilitated sending and receiving
        a single query over either UDP or TCP. New APIs and deployment
        of DNSSEC validating resolvers on hosts that in the past were
        using stub resolving only is increasing the DNS client base that
        prefer using long lived TCP connections. Long-lived TCP connections
        can result in lower request latency than the case where UDP
        transport is used and truncated responses are received, since
        clients that have fallen back to TCP transport in response to a
        truncated response typically only uses the TCP session for a
        single (request, response) pair, continuing with UDP transport
        for subsequent queries. Clients wishing to use
        other TCP based technologies, for example TLS, would also benefit
        from the set-up amortisation afforded by long lived connections.</t>

      <t>UDP transport is stateless, and hence presents a much
	lower resource burden on a busy DNS server than TCP. An
	exchange of DNS messages over UDP can also be completed in
	a single round trip between communicating hosts, resulting
	in optimally-short transaction times. UDP transport is not
	without its risks, however.</t>

      <t>A single-datagram exchange over UDP between two hosts
	can be exploited to enable a reflection attack on a third
	party. Mitigation of such attacks on authoritative-only
	servers is possible using an approach known as Response
	Rate-Limiting <xref target="RRL"/>, an approach designed
	to minimise the frequency at which legitimate responses are
	discarded by truncating responses that appear to be motivated
	by an attacker, forcing legitimate clients to re-query using
	TCP transport.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC1035"/> specified a maximum DNS message
	size over UDP transport of 512 bytes.  Deployment of DNSSEC
	<xref target="RFC4033"/> and other protocols subsequently
	increased the observed frequency at which responses exceed
	this limit. EDNS0 <xref target="RFC6891"/> allows DNS
	messages larger than 512 bytes to be exchanged over UDP,
	with a corresponding increased incidence of fragmentation.
	Fragmentation is known to be problematic in general, and
	has also been implicated in increasing the risk of cache
	poisoning attacks.</t>

      <t>The use of TCP transport does not suffer from the risks
	of fragmentation nor reflection attacks. However, TCP
	transport as currently deployed has expensive overhead.</t>

      <t>The overhead of the three-way TCP handshake for a single
	DNS transaction is substantial, increasing the transaction
	time for a single (request, response) pair of DNS messages
	from 1 x RTT to 2 x RTT. There is no such overhead for a session that
	is already established, however, and the overall impact of
	the TCP setup handshake when the resulting session is used
	to exchange N DNS message pairs over a single session, (1
	+ N)/N, approaches unity as N increases.</t>

      <t>(It should perhaps be noted that the overhead for a DNS
	transaction over UDP truncated due to RRL is 3x RTT, higher
	than the overhead imposed on the same transaction initiated
	over TCP.)</t>

      <t>With increased deployment of DNSSEC and new RRtypes containing
         application specific cryptographic material, there is an increase
         in the prevalence of truncated responses received over UDP with
         fallback to TCP.</t>

      <t>The use of TCP transport requires considerably more state
	to be retained on DNS servers.  If a server is to perform
	adequately with a significant query load received over TCP,
	it must manage its available resources to ensure that all
	established TCP sessions are well-used, and that those remain
	idle for long periods are closed promptly.</t>

      <t>This document proposes a signalling mechanism between DNS
	clients and servers that provides a means to
	better balance the use of UDP and TCP transport, reducing
	the impact of problems associated with UDP whilst constraining
	the impact of TCP on response times and server resources
	to a manageable level.</t>

       <t>The reduced overhead of this extension adds up significantly
          when combined with other edns extensions, such as
           <xref target="CHAIN-QUERY"/> and <xref target="STARTTLS"/>. For example, 
           the combination of
          these such EDNS extensions make it possible for hosts on
          high-latency mobile networks to natively perform DNSSEC validation and encrypt queries.

        <section title="Sending Queries">
          <t>DNS clients MAY include the edns-tcp-keepalive option
            in queries sent using UDP transport to signal their
            general ability to support TCP keepalive.</t>

          <t>DNS clients MAY include the edns-tcp-keepalive option
            in the first query sent to a server using TCP transport
            to signal their desire to keep the connection open when idle.</t>

          <t>Clients MAY specify a TIMEOUT value that is representative
            of what they intend to use on the connection.</t>

          <t>QUESTION: Is the client timeout really useful, or should we instead have clients set 
              all the bits to 1 and require servers not to use that value to identify cases where 
              the ENDS0 option is simply being reflected back.</t>

	</section>

        <section title="Receiving Responses">
	  <t>A DNS client that receives a response using UDP transport
	    that includes the edns-tcp-keepalive option MAY record
	    the presence of the option and the associated TIMEOUT
	    value, and use that information as part of its server
	    selection algorithm in the case where multiple candidate
	    servers are available to service a particular query.</t>

	  <t>A DNS client that receives a response using TCP transport
	    that includes the edns-tcp-keepalive option MAY keep the
	    existing TCP session open when it is idle. It SHOULD honour the
	    timeout and initiate close
	    of the connection before the timeout expires. [Add reference to 5966 idle discussion?]</t>

	  <t>A DNS client that receives a response that includes the edns-tcp-keepalive option
	      with a TIMEOUT value of 0 should send no more queries on that connection and initiate
	      close the connection as soon as it has received all outstanding responses.</t>

      <t> A DNS client that receives a response to a query that contained the edns-keepalive-option 
          where the response does not also contain the edns-keepalive-option should assume the
          server does not support keepalive and behave following the guidance in 5966-bis (TODO: Add 
          reference). This holds true even if a previous edns-keepalive-option exchange occurred on 
          the existing TCP connection.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Use by DNS Servers">
        <section title="Receiving Queries">
	  <t>A DNS server that receives a query using UDP transport
	    that includes the edns-tcp-keepalive option MAY record
	    the presence of the option for statistical purposes, but should not otherwise
	    modify its usual behaviour in sending a response.</t>

          <t>A DNS server that receives a query using TCP transport that includes
           the edns-tcp-keepalive option MAY modify the idle timeout
           associated with that TCP session if resources permit, using the TIMEOUT
           value supplied by the client as a guide.</t>

	</section>

        <section title="Sending Responses">
	  <t>DNS servers MAY include the edns-tcp-keepalive option
	    in responses sent using UDP transport to signal their general
	    ability to use keepalive timeouts.  The TIMEOUT value
	    should be indicative of what a client might expect if it was
	    to open a TCP session with the server and receive a response
	    with the edns-tcp-keepalive option present.</t>

	  <t>DNS servers MAY include the edns-tcp-keepalive option
	    in responses sent using TCP transport to signal their
	    expected idle timeout on a connection. Servers MUST specify the TIMEOUT value
	    that is currently associated with the TCP session. It is
	    reasonable for this value to change according to local
	    resource constraints. The DNS server SHOULD send a
	    edns-tcp-keepalive option with a timeout of 0 if it deems its local resources
	    are too low to service more TCP keepalive sessions.</t>
	</section>
      </section>

      <section title="TCP Session Management">
	<t>Both DNS clients and servers are subject to resource
	  constraints which will limit the extent to which TCP
	  sessions can persist. Effective limits for the number of
	  active sessions that can be maintained on individual
	  clients and servers should be established, either as
	  configuration options or by interrogation of process
	  limits imposed by the operating system. In particular, servers
	  that signal keepalive capability should engage in TCP connection 
	  management by recycling existing connections when appropriate 
	  and managing request queues to enable fair use.(ref 5966-bis here?)</t>

	<t>In the event that there is greater demand for TCP sessions
	  than can be accommodated, servers may reduce
	  the TIMEOUT value signalled in successive DNS messages
	  to minimise idle time on existing sessions.  This also allows,
	  for example, clients with other candidate servers to query
	  to establish new TCP sessions with different servers in
	  expectation that an existing session is likely to be
	  closed, or to fall back to UDP.</t>

   <t>Based on TCP session resources servers may signal a
       TIMEOUT value of 0 to request clients to close
       connections as soon as possible. This is useful when, server resources 
       become very low, or a 
       denial-of-service attack is detected and further maximises the shifting of
       TIME_WAIT state to well-behaved clients. </t>

	<t>DNS clients and servers MAY close a TCP session at any
	  time in order to manage local resource constraints.  The
	  algorithm by which clients and servers rank active TCP
	  sessions in order to determine which to close is not
	  specified in this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Non-Clean Paths">
	<t>Many paths between DNS clients and servers suffer from
	  poor hygiene, limiting the free flow of DNS messages that
	  include particular EDNS0 options, or messages that exceed
	  a particular size. A fallback strategy similar to that
	  described in <xref target="RFC6891"/> section 6.2.2 SHOULD
	  be employed to avoid persistent interference due to
	  non-clean paths.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Anycast Considerations">
	<t>DNS servers of various types are commonly deployed using
	  anycast <xref target="RFC4786"/>.</t>

	<t>Successive DNS transactions between a client and server
	  using UDP transport may involve responses generated by
	  different anycast nodes, and the use of anycast in the
	  implementation of a DNS server is effectively undetectable
	  by the client. The edns-tcp-keepalive option SHOULD NOT
	  be included in responses using UDP transport from servers
	  provisioned using anycast unless all anycast server nodes are capable
	  of processing the edns-tcp-keepalive option.</t>

	<t>Changes in network topology between clients and anycast
	  servers may cause disruption to TCP sessions making use
	  of edns-tcp-keepalive more often than with TCP sessions
	  that omit it, since the TCP sessions are expected to be
	  longer-lived. Anycast servers MAY make use of TCP multipath
	  <xref target="RFC6824"/> to anchor the server side of the
	  TCP connection to an unambiguously-unicast address in
	  order to avoid disruption due to topology changes.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The edns-tcp-keep-alive option can potentially be abused
	to request large numbers of sessions in a quick burst.  When
	a Nameserver detects abusive behaviour, it SHOULD immediately
	close the TCP connection and free all buffers used.</t>

      <t>This section needs more work. As usual.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>The IANA is directed to assign an EDNS0 option code for
